Predict high or low blood sugar episodes in Type 1 diabetics

# Data
The data for this project includes all-day heart-rate data, blood glucose readings, carbohydrates consumed, and 
insulin doses administered.
Heart Rate data is gathered using the garminDb program, which uses the user's Garmin Connect credentials to download 
the monitoring data collecting by their running watch. Blood glucose data will be gathered from the user's Dexcom 
Clarity account. Food and Insulin data will likely be gathered from myFitnessPal.

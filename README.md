# Glucose Prediction with Dexcom, Garmin, and MyFitnessPal
# Overview
This project aims to help individuals with Type 1 diabetes predict high or low blood sugar episodes by analyzing a combination of heart rate, glucose levels, food intake, and insulin administration data. By leveraging real-time data from health-tracking devices and apps, this project aims to provide actionable insights to help users manage their blood sugar levels more effectively.
- Heart Rate Data: Collected from Garmin devices capable of continuous heart rate monitoring, accessed via the Garmin Connect API.
- Blood Glucose Data: Downloaded from the user's Dexcom Clarity account, which tracks continuous glucose monitor (CGM) data.
- Food and Insulin Data: Pulled from MyFitnessPal and Dexcom Clarity, providing records of carbohydrate consumption and insulin doses.
# Key Features
## Federated Login 
The app provides federated login functionality, allowing users to securely connect their Dexcom Clarity, Garmin Connect, and MyFitnessPal accounts. To use the app, users must have:
## User Devices and Accounts
- Dexcom CGM tracks blood glucose levels (Dexcom Clarity account).
- Garmin device with heart rate monitoring capabilities (Garmin Connect account).
- MyFitnessPal to log food intake (carbohydrates) and insulin administration.
## Machine Learning Model 
Given the sequential and temporal nature of the data, a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model is ideal for this task. These models are good for time series predictions, as they can maintain and use memory of previous states to improve forecasting accuracy.
The model will use recent time windows of heart rate, glucose readings, and food/insulin events to predict future blood sugar levels. The system will give higher weight to more recent events when making predictions, which aligns with the goal of real-time monitoring.
### Feature Engineering
The input features will include heart rate, glucose levels, insulin doses, and food intake, with the possibility of including additional features like time of day, exercise intensity, or sleep patterns.
### Training
The model will be trained on time series data, using a sliding window approach to capture sequential data over a fixed time range (e.g., the last 30 minutes to several hours).
### Target Variable
The target variable for the model will be the future blood glucose level, predicted over short intervals (e.g., 5, 10, 30 minutes into the future).
## Training Data Pipeline
A background data pipeline will gather, consolidate, and prepare data from the following sources:
- Dexcom Clarity API: Fetches continuous glucose readings.
- Garmin Connect: Collects heart rate data via GarminDB (SQLite database).
- MyFitnessPal API: Tracks food consumption (carbohydrates) and insulin dosage information.
- This data will be used to generate time series datasets that capture key eventsâ€”heart rate changes, blood sugar fluctuations, food intake, and insulin administration.
A good candidate for this is AWS Lambda; Step Functions as well, depending on how extensive the procedure is.
## Real-Time Blood Sugar Prediction
Once the model is trained on historical data, the app will predict future blood sugar levels based on the most recent input from the data sources.
The model will continuously evaluate recent data and offer pre-emptive suggestions for the user to address potential high or low blood sugar events. These suggestions may include adjusting insulin doses, consuming fast-acting carbohydrates, or moderating exercise intensity.
## Remediation Suggestions
The app will provide real-time alerts for potential blood sugar issues, such as impending lows or highs. These alerts will offer practical recommendations, such as:
- Taking an insulin dose to counteract a high.
- Eating a fast-acting carbohydrate to prevent a low.
- Reducing/Increasing exercise intensity to stabilize blood sugar.
# Development Considerations
A cross-platform mobile app (iOS and Android) is the goal, due to the personal nature of the data and the need for real-time monitoring. Most users will want to access the app via their smartphones, as it allows them to get immediate updates and alerts on their glucose levels.
## Framework 
A framework like Flutter or React Native would be suitable for building a cross-platform mobile app that can run on both iOS and Android devices with a single codebase.
## Real-Time Data Access
The app will use the same APIs as the training pipeline to pull real-time data from Dexcom Clarity, Garmin Connect, and MyFitnessPal. Users will receive immediate feedback and alerts based on their latest data, but optimization will be essential; we'll need to be able to pull the appropriate window of data to the users device, and relatively quickly. Blood sugar lows can appear quickly and if the user is depending on the app for predicting this, it has to be fast enough.
## Privacy and Security
Since this project may eventually deal with sensitive health data, privacy and security will be considered. All data transfers could be encrypted, and users' login credentials will be handled using OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication with third-party services (Dexcom, Garmin, MyFitnessPal).
## HIPAA Compliance
For future scaling and user acquisition, the app will need to meet HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) standards to protect users' personal health information.
